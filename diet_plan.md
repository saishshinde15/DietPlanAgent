Okay, here is a personalized 7-day vegetarian diet plan designed for a 180 cm, 78 kg male aiming for weight loss. This plan targets approximately **1900 calories per day**, focusing on balanced nutrition with whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits, and lean vegetarian protein sources.

**Nutritional Goals Summary:**
*   **Calorie Target:** ~1900 kcal/day (for a moderate deficit to promote weight loss)
*   **Dietary Preference:** Vegetarian (Lacto-vegetarian focused, includes dairy; easily adaptable for vegans by swapping dairy for plant-based alternatives like fortified soy/almond milk/yogurt and ensuring B12 intake).
*   **Focus:** High fiber, adequate protein for satiety and muscle maintenance, healthy fats, complex carbohydrates, and ample micronutrients from diverse plant sources.

**Important Notes:**
*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day (aim for 8-10 glasses).
*   **Portion Sizes:** These are estimates. Adjust slightly based on your specific hunger levels, but try to stick close to the plan for weight loss. Use measuring cups/spoons initially.
*   **Cooking Methods:** Prioritize steaming, grilling, baking, roasting, stir-frying with minimal oil (use olive oil, avocado oil, or coconut oil sparingly).
*   **Activity:** Complement this diet plan with regular physical activity (a mix of cardio and strength training is ideal) for best results.
*   **Flexibility:** Feel free to swap days, or exchange meals with similar calorie counts/macros if needed. Use fresh, seasonal produce whenever possible.
*   **Listen to Your Body:** If you feel excessively hungry or overly full, adjust portion sizes slightly. Weight loss is a gradual process.
